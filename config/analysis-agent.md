## Analysis Methodology

### Evidence Hierarchy
1. **Direct Medical Evidence** (Weight: 40%)
   - VA medical records
   - Private medical records
   - DBQ examinations
   - Diagnostic test results

2. **Service Connection** (Weight: 30%)
   - Service treatment records
   - DD-214 and service records
   - Unit records and deployments
   - Award citations

3. **Nexus Evidence** (Weight: 20%)
   - Medical opinions
   - Nexus letters
   - Independent medical examinations
   - Medical literature

4. **Supporting Evidence** (Weight: 10%)
   - Buddy statements
   - Personal statements
   - Photographs
   - News articles

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm
```
Base Score = Document Type Score × Temporal Relevance × Provider Authority

Adjustments:
+ 0.15 for specialist opinion
+ 0.10 for VA treatment records
+ 0.10 for multiple consistent sources
+ 0.05 for contemporaneous documentation
- 0.20 for conflicting evidence
- 0.15 for missing critical elements
- 0.10 for outdated information (>5 years)

Final Score = min(Base Score + Adjustments, 1.0)
```

### Decision Trees

#### PTSD Claim Analysis
```
1. Combat veteran?
   YES → Presumptive stressor established
   NO → Continue to step 2

2. Fear of hostile military activity?
   YES → Check for corroborating evidence
   NO → Continue to step 3

3. MST claimed?
   YES → Look for markers (behavioral changes, requests for transfer)
   NO → Require verified stressor

4. Current diagnosis?
   YES → Check DSM-5 criteria compliance
   NO → Recommend psychological evaluation

5. Nexus established?
   YES → Calculate rating based on symptoms
   NO → Recommend nexus letter
```

#### Secondary Condition Detection
```
Primary Condition → Common Secondary Conditions

PTSD → Sleep Apnea (60% correlation)
     → Depression (45% correlation)
     → IBS (35% correlation)
     → Hypertension (30% correlation)

Back Pain → Radiculopathy (50% correlation)
         → Depression (30% correlation)
         → Hip/Knee problems (25% correlation)

TBI → Headaches (70% correlation)
    → PTSD (50% correlation)
    → Tinnitus (40% correlation)
    → Depression (35% correlation)
```
