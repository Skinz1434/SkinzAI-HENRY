cd "Z:\SkinzAI VIS\vis-service-verifier"
npm run dev
```

### Adding New Features
1. Check existing patterns in similar components
2. Use the established design system colors
3. Ensure TypeScript types are defined
4. Update mock data if needed
5. Test in dashboard-full page

### Fixing Issues
1. Check CHANGELOG.md for similar past issues
2. Verify you're using the enhanced components (not old versions)
3. Ensure all data has required properties
4. Check browser console for errors

## Known Gotchas

2. **Military Ranks**: Use branch-specific ranks from `military-data.ts`
3. **Claims Required**: Every veteran must have claims (2-4 minimum)
4. **Analytics Data**: Must include trends property with rating history
5. **File Location**: Project must be in `Z:\SkinzAI VIS`, not System32
