### The Henry Protocol - Core Features

#### Multi-Domain Risk Synthesis
Analyzes risk across 6 critical domains:
1. Mental Health
2. Financial Stability
3. Housing Security
4. Substance Use
5. Social Connection
6. Physical Health

#### Cascade Detection
Identifies problem cascades before crisis:
```
Job Loss → Financial Stress → Medication Non-adherence → 
Mental Health Decline → Substance Use → Crisis
```

#### Risk Stratification
- Immediate (90+): 24-48 hour intervention
- High (70-89): 1 week outreach
- Moderate (50-69): 2 week monitoring
- Low (30-49): Monthly check-ins
- Minimal (<30): Standard care

### Performance Metrics
| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| F2 Score | 92% | Optimized for recall |
| Precision | 89% | High accuracy |
| Recall | 95% | Catches at-risk veterans |
| AUROC | 94% | Excellent discrimination |
| Processing | <30s | 500 profiles |
| Prediction | 30-60 days | Early intervention |
