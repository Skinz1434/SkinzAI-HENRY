# CHANGELOG

## [0.2.1] - 2025-09-04 - Build & Deployment Resolution

### ‚ö° Quick Summary
Fixed critical TypeScript errors, implemented proper VA disability calculations (10% increments only), ensured all veterans with ratings have matching conditions, and resolved Vercel deployment cache issues.

### üöÄ Key Fixes
- **Build**: All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- **VA Ratings**: Now uses official VA combined ratings table (38 CFR 4.25)
- **Data Integrity**: Veterans with ratings always have conditions (no more 81% with 0 conditions)
- **Deployment**: Cache invalidation via version bump to force Vercel rebuild

### üì¶ New Utilities
- `va-rating-calculator.ts` - Official VA rating calculations
- `medical-record-generator.ts` - Realistic medical documentation
- `enhanced-mock-data.ts` - Proper data generation with conditions

### üîÑ Deployment Resolution
If Vercel is stuck on old commit (97c98d1):
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Project Settings
2. Clear build cache or trigger manual deployment
3. Latest working commits: `5030377` or `c4c1110`
