## 💾 DATABASE CONFIGURATION

### Schema Development
- ✅ Created pristine `schema.sql` with:
  - 14 tables (veterans, claims, conditions, deployments, etc.)
  - 7 custom enum types (military_branch, discharge_status, etc.)
  - 31 indexes for performance
  - 4 PL/pgSQL functions (encryption, risk scoring)
  - 2 views (high_risk_veterans, veteran_summary)
  - Complete RLS policies

### Data Population

  - 191 high-risk veterans for cascade detection
  - Deployments with era-specific locations and exposures
  - Medical conditions linked to service
  - 2-4 claims per eligible veteran
  - Risk assessments for high-risk veterans
